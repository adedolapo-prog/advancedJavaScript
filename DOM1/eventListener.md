# What are Event Listeners?

Event listeners are one of the most widely used structures in javascript. They allow us monitor events that occur and add functionality to the event once it is triggered. Events can take place in various forms. It can be a click of a buton, hovering over an icon and so on.
An event listener listens for when these events are triggered and adds a function to such event.

There are different event types. Some of them include:

- Mouse Events: they include click, double click, mouseover, mouse up and so on.
- Touch Events: they include touchstart, touchmove, touchend
- Keyboard Events: they include keypress, keyup
- Form Events: they include submit, change, input
- User Interface Events: they include resize, scroll, error etc
- Focus and Blur Events: they include blur, focus,

Event listeners are usually included using the method:
object.addEventListener(event, function).
