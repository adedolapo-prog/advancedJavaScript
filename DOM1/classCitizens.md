# first class citizens

This simply refers to objects which can perform everything other objects can do. They are an entity(object, value, type) which supports all the operations generally available to other entities. It simply means an entity can operate as another entity in a separate case or scenario. It can be passed as an argument, returned from a subroutine and assigned to a variable.

    For example, a function in javascript can be passed as a parameter in another function or the value from a function can be passed as a parameter in another function.

# second class citizen

This on the other hand can only be passed as an argument.
